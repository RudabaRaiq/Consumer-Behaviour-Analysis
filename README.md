# Consumer-Behaviour-Analysis
As a unique component of my Data Science internship with #OESON Private Ltd, this is my third and fourth project named “Consumer Behaviour Analysis” of #OGTIP #Oeson where I utilise Python to EDA-Exploratory Data Analysis and MLA-Machine Learning Algorithm of the limited data from a reputed retail website that include relevant information of the consumer behaviour through website engagement for multiple product purchase where I share insights and analysing with MLA consumer behaviour trends in this dynamic world nowadays.. 

I want to express my gratitude to the team of #OESON for the chance and #Minakshi Gautam for her assistance with this project.

Actually, I have tried to extract meaningful insight from this data to explain the actual customer behaviour performing detail EDA on the data and preparing a prediction model which predicts whether a consumer will purchase the product after their visit on the website.
